**Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

Welcome to the Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe Game! This project implements a web-based version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a twist. In this version, there are nine smaller Tic-Tac-Toe boards, and winning on a small board grants you control of a position on the larger, ultimate board.

### How to Play

1. **Objective:**
   - The objective of the game is to win three small Tic-Tac-Toe boards in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
   - Winning three small boards in a row grants you control of the larger, ultimate board. The first player to win three small boards in a row on the ultimate board wins the game.

2. **Gameplay:**
   - Players take turns placing their symbol ('X' or 'O') on the small boards.
   - The cell clicked on a small board determines which small board the next player must play on. For example, if 'X' plays on cell (1, 2) of a small board, 'O' must play on the small board at position (1, 2) on the ultimate board.
   - The game continues until one player wins the ultimate board or all small boards are filled, resulting in a tie.

### How to Use

1. **Starting a New Game:**
   - Click on the "New Game" button to start a new game at any time.
   - The game automatically resets when a player wins or the game ends in a tie.

2. **Resetting the Game:**
   - Click on the "Reset Game" button to reset the current game and start over.
